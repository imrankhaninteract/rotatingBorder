How To Create Stunning Rotating Border Effects with Overlays
The HTML document begins by declaring its document type and setting the language to English. The head section contains metadata, specifying the character encoding and viewport settings, along with a title of Rotating Border. Within the style block, various CSS rules are defined to style the webpage elements. The body element is styled to have a background image fetched from a specified URL, light text color, padding for top spacing, and centeraligned text. The background image is set to cover the entire body and adjust proportionally. The body's height is set to occupy 100 percent of the viewport height.

The main section is established with flexbox properties to organize content in a centered, flexible layout with specified gaps and margins, allowing items to wrap onto multiple lines if necessary. A div element within the main section is styled to have a minimum width of 600 pixels, a height of 100 pixels, a relative position, a rounded border, and a pointer cursor for interaction. Hovering over the div triggers a change in opacity for its pseudoelement after, as well as when the associated checkbox is checked or unchecked.

The pseudoelement after for the div is configured to have an empty content block, displayed as a blocklevel element, absolutely positioned within its container, featuring a background color, border radius, and a transition effect for opacity changes. Additionally, a custom property r is defined to manage an angle value in a conic gradient background applied to the div with the ID a. An animation named rotating is established, setting the custom property r to 0 degrees at the animation's start and 360 degrees at its end, creating a continuous rotation effect with a duration of 3 seconds, linear timing, and infinite looping. The HTML body includes a checkbox input and label, as well as an empty div element inside the main section, with the ID a. This HTML and CSS code work together to produce a webpage demonstrating a rotating border effect.
